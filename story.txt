Sarah was enjoying a truly wonderful day until she fell victim to the world's greatest injustice- a strange man ran by and snatched the Döner right out of her hand before she could even take a bite!
Upset and hungry, Sarah chased the stranger down the Haupstrasse, running faster than a Porsche GT3RS.
She hunted him down like a Hund all the way to the Flughafen, growing numb to the hunger and rage. 
She saw a plane take off from the Flughafen Berlin and thought she'd lost him, when she saw a man holding her doener speed away in a car.
