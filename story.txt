Sarah was enjoying a truly wonderful day until she fell victim to the world's greatest injustice- a strange man ran by and snatched the doener right out of her hand before she could even take a bite!
Upset and hungry, Sarah chased the stranger down the Haupstrasse, running faster than a Porsche GT3RS.
She hunted him down like a Hund all the way to the Flughafen, growing numb to the hunger and rage. 
She saw a plane take off from the Flughafen Berlin and thought she'd lost him, when she saw a man holding her doener speed away in a car.
Sarah commandeered a BMW M8 Competition Coupe to pursue the stranger, flipping on the radio to Rammstein — the perfect soundtrack for a car chase.
Her dirndl flapping in the wind, she gained ground on the thief until he took a desperate turn at too high a speed that sent him skidding straight into a biergarten!
The thief learned the hard way that not having a speed limit on the Autobahn is only great until your car is flipped over in a biergarten, but at least the Porsche's klimaanlage can help the patrons cool down a bit from the summer heat!
Sarah sat eating a bratwurst, happy knowing that the thief was caught, until she remembered that she never recovered her doener!
As she picked up her doener, now covered in dirt after being flung from the Porsche, she took this as a sign and decided to instead get an apfelkuchen to satiate her hunger.
With her hunger for food and justice finally statisfied, Sarah was finally able to relax while watching a beautiful sun setting behind the distand Schloss.
